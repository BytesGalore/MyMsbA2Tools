Using the ttyConnector enables to connect and interact with an MSB-A2 using a tty device connection.
It represents a base for future MSB-A2 interacting tools (and maybe other devices). 

Right now it is not tested or documented well, so beware.
(tested with gcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.7.3-1ubuntu1) 4.7.3 )

As it uses C++11 features, i.e. std::mutex and std::thread, it is mandatory to use the: 
-std=c++0x and -lpthread for a successfull build.

TODO
- include Makefile
- document all functions
- test all functions
